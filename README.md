# Logistic-Map

This small project was developed during the Vida Artificial (2023/24) curricular unit at the Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa.

**How to Run:**

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - Execute `python3 -m venv ./env` to establish a virtual environment named "env" in the current directory.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Activate the virtual environment with `source ./env/bin/activate`. You should observe a change in the prompt, indicating successful activation.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the necessary dependencies for your project by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. The required dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Run the Project:**
   - Execute `python3 main.py` to launch the `main.py` script, assumed to be the primary entry point for your project.

Ensure that you substitute `python3` with the appropriate command if you are using a different Python version. Additionally, confirm that you are in the correct directory containing your project files, including `main.py` and `requirements.txt`.
